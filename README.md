# evolutionData
Many of our lab members use sequence alignment data within the context of evolution. The existing MAF files efficiently stores sequences from different species but using programs to extract orthologous sequences from .maf files can take days to months. I introduce how I preprocessed the ortholoous sequence data and where it is saved.
